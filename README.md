# NodeJS-Java-implementation
Example implementation of a Nodejs-Java client Server implementation

<b><u>Description</u></b>

I had been looking for a NodeJs client to Java server implementation using sockets. After all the googling and searching I ended making this implementation up. The example files here are basic at best and useful for programmers looking for an initial scratch 

<b><u>Files</u></b>
<li>Form.js -- The node js form and client implementation that accepts the inputs </li>
<li>MyServerSocket.java -- The Java server that listens for incoming connections </li>

# Usage
1. Open the java class and the nodejs implementation. Within both files <u><b>change the default IP address</b></u>. 
2. Run the server first (I imported the file to an IDE and ran it there )
3. Run the nodejs implementation (YOu need to have node installed)
4. Open up the IP address where the pages are stored. 


#Hope this helps... Thanks !
